# Forecast volatility
volatility_forecast = gemma3.forecast_volatility('SPY', price_data)

# Analyze correlations
correlation_analysis = gemma3.analyze_correlations(market_data)
```

### Strategy Generation and Refinement

```python
# Generate strategy
strategy = gemma3.generate_strategy(
    asset_type='stock',
    market_conditions={'regime': 'bullish'},
    trading_objectives={'risk_tolerance': 'moderate'}
)

# Refine strategy
refined_strategy = gemma3.refine_strategy(
    strategy=strategy,
    market_conditions={'regime': 'bullish'},
    refinement_goals={'improve_win_rate': True}
)
```

### Trading Recommendations

```python
# Generate trading recommendation
recommendation = gemma3.generate_trading_recommendation(
    ticker='SPY',
    market_data=market_data,
    news_data=news_data,
    sentiment_data=sentiment_data,
    trading_objectives=trading_objectives
)

# Generate exit recommendation
exit_recommendation = gemma3.generate_exit_recommendation(
    ticker='SPY',
    position=position,
    market_data=market_data,
    news_data=news_data,
    sentiment_data=sentiment_data
)
```

### Market Insights and Portfolio Management

```python
# Generate market insights
market_insights = gemma3.generate_market_insights(
    market_data=market_data,
    economic_data=economic_data,
    news_data=news_data
)

# Generate portfolio recommendations
portfolio_recommendations = gemma3.generate_portfolio_recommendations(
    portfolio=portfolio,
    market_data=market_data,
    trading_objectives=trading_objectives
)
```

## QBTS Swing Trading Strategy

The QBTS (Quantitative Behavioral Trading Strategy) swing trading strategy demonstrates how to use the Gemma 3 integration to implement a sophisticated trading strategy that combines technical analysis, sentiment analysis, and market regime detection.

### Initialization

```python
from backend.strategies.qbts_swing_trading import QBTSSwingTradingStrategy
from backend.gemma3_integration.gemma3_integration import Gemma3Integration

# Initialize Gemma 3 integration
gemma3 = Gemma3Integration()

# Initialize QBTS strategy
qbts = QBTSSwingTradingStrategy(gemma3)
```

### Analyzing Market Conditions

```python
# Analyze market conditions
market_insights = qbts.analyze_market_conditions(
    market_data=market_data,
    economic_data=economic_data,
    news_data=news_data
)
```
